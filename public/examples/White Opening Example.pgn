{ Black develops the Knight to c6, defending the black e5 pawn while also fighting for control of d4. 

White now can choose between several well known openings. Ruy Lopez (Bb5) , Italian (Bc4) and Scotch (d4) are all solid openings that see regular play at all levels. With Ruy Lopez, white seeks to immediately chase the initiative and attacks the defender of the black e5 pawn. While in Italian the Bishop on c4 target's the black f7 pawn, the weakest pawn in the starting position. Scotch with d4, instead often lead to more concrete variations, starting with the pawns getting exchanged right away. } { [%cal Ge2e4] }
1. e4 { [%cal Re7e5] } 1... e5 { [%cal Gg1f3] } 2. Nf3 { Nf3 is the classic of all classic moves. The knight on f3 immediately fights for control of the center, by attacking the black e5 pawn. It also serves as supporting a potential d2-d4 move. Across many openings, it's common to develop the knight before the bishop. This is because, there is usually only one good square for the knight, while the bishop have several options. We can see this exemplified in black's most common response, Nc6.
After 2... Nc6, to defend the black e5 pawn, white can place the Bishop on b5 or c4. That is either Ruy Lopez or the Italian game. } { [%cal Rb8c6] } 2... Nc6 { Black develops the Knight to c6, defending the black e5 pawn while also fighting for control of d4.

{ The Open Sicilian is a very popular opening. There is a great deal of theory on the opening and it is also typically very tactical. For these two reasons some people who do not play the Sicilian will avoid playing the Open Sicilian to encourage slower maneuvering instead of sharp tactics. } { [%csl Ge4][%cal Ge2e4] }
1. e4 { [%cal Rc7c5] } 1... c5 { [%csl Gf3][%cal Gg1f3] } 2. Nf3 { [%csl Rc6,Rg6][%cal Rb8c6,Rg7g6] } 2... Nc6 { 2. ...Nc6 continues development and covers the d4 and e5 squares while still keeping retaining the option to push either d5 or e5 in one move.
Within the Open Sicilians after 3. d4 it is most frequently used as the move order to reach a Sveshnikov setup after a subsequent 3. ...cxd 4. Nxd Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 - where the central pressure and threat of Bb4 force White into the complications that arise from 6. Ndb5. Another very important option is the Accelerated Dragon after 3. d4 cxd 4. Nxd g6 - where the purpose of Nc6 was to rule out a White Qxd4. } { [%csl Gc5][%cal Gd2d4,Gd4c5] } (2... g6 { This early g6 in the Sicilian signifies the Hyper-Accelerated Dragon, also called the Hungarian variation (not to be mistaken with the Hungarian Defense, which appears after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Be7). The main idea in the Hyper-Accelerated Dragon (HAD) is to delay d6, in order to be able to play the liberating d5 push in one go. This move is a gambit but is sound and is considered mainline. The advantage of this is that if white goes for the classical moves 3.d4 c.cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6 5.Nc3, Black can choose to prevent White from having the usual setup with Be3, Bc4, Qd2, and O-O-O. He can also transpose back into the regular dragon by playing d6.
The main drawback of this variation is that having delayed Nf6, White can play c4 before Nc3, setting up a Maroczy bind. The position is still equal, but black must know how to respond effectively, because it is easy to suffocate in this cramped position. } { [%csl Gd4][%cal Gd2d4] } 3. d4) 3. d4 *
